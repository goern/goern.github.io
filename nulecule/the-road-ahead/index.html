<h2 id="_preface">Preface</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>During the past half year I was involved in the invention and development of
the <a href="http://www.projectatomic.io/docs/nulecule/">Nulecule Specification</a> and its reference implementation <a href="https://github.com/projectatomic/atomicapp">Atomic App</a>.
While we have come from a very small team hacking some python code, development of
Atomic App is now hosted by the <a href="https://www.redhat.com/mailman/listinfo/container-tools">container-tools team of Red Hat</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We have seem some requirements and have had some reality checks, but the goal
of the Nulecule Specification remains unchanged:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Package once. Run anywhere.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Compose applications from a catalog.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>"MSI Installer for containers".</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Change runtime parameters for different environments.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>With this article I will explore a little deeper on our goals and what we
archived. Additionally I will put some more goal on the list, as they have
come up over the past iterations [of development].</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_current_state">Current State</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The Nulecule Specification itself is undergoing a reality check: we are starting
to use it for Red Hat&#8217;s own products, like our <a href="https://github.com/BitScoutOrg/nulecule-elasticsearch/blob/master/Nulecule">BitScout&#8217;s elasticsearch</a>,
but also for products of our ISVs, like <a href="https://github.com/kanarip/kolab-atomicapp">Kolab</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We have some requests for extensions and some unclear formulations what have or
will be fixed.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>During the course of <a href="http://europe-2015.dockercon.com/">DockerCon</a> talk with <a href="https://github.com/helm/helm">other</a> <a href="https://giantswarm.io/">initiatives</a> have been started to
explore the opportunities to collaborate.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>So in summary: we try to keep the Nulecule Specification alive and validate
opportunities to extend it and make it more usable/adopted.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Moving from the specification to the implementation, we have made great progress,
<a href="https://github.com/projectatomic/atomicapp/milestones/CDK%202%20GA">Atomic App has
a roadmap to it&#8217;s GA release</a>, it is shared on github.
Some providers (that is platforms atomicapp can deploy to) have been implemented,
beside <a href="http://kubernetes.io/">Kubernetes</a> and <a href="https://www.openshift.org/">OpenShift</a>
there is a first version of a <a href="https://github.com/projectatomic/atomicapp/pull/392">Marathon provider</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Implementing the Nulecule Specification is on a good track, Atomic App it the
reference implementation, and I have experimented with a few aspects of the
Nulecule Specification with <a href="https://github.com/goern/grasshopper">Grasshopper</a>.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_findings">Findings</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>First of all, it was a hard task to extend the team of three hackers to a powerful
and organized group. This is a finding for me: one needs to talk more in person
and in detail if such a early handover is to be done.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Getting ISV (or application developers) on the train is also hard. Even though
we have provided some examples, there is a need for a
<a href="https://github.com/projectatomic/nulecule/issues/162#issuecomment-137359068">walk
through style turorial</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The Nulecule Specification is good and 'kind of complete' &#8482; but it lacks
adoption, so we need to get a lot better on the marketing track, a shiny website,
more involvement in other communities, more talks&#8230;&#8203; more of eveything!</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>By now the Nulecule Specification is focused on multi container applications.
The aspect of a library of reusable components is widely ignored by now. We need
to come back to this and think of it as a quality kickstart for developers.
<a href="https://gist.github.com/vpavlin/5d81cfa2853548e24666">Vašek has started the
<em>atomicapp index</em> command</a>, but it lacks&#8230;&#8203; marketing and support by
container-tools team.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><a href="https://www.redhat.com/archives/container-tools/2015-June/msg00036.html">Integration with cockpit</a>
is not receiving enough love, Cockpit is a perfect web based user interface to
be 'the MSI installer' part of the Nulecule/Atomic App story, but sometimes
things bork&#8230;&#8203;</p>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_new_requirements">New Requirements</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For me, there is one more thing to do: deeper integration of the Nulecule
Specification and application definition. If we take a closer look at how an
Atomic App works, we see that the Nulecule is a layer of meta data ontop of the
containers themselves. I think we can give a bigger value to persons responsible
to deploy and run an application by thighly couple the Nulecule and application
description. We could generate parts of the one from the other, we can reuse
information present in the application on the Nulecule layer.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Again, I have started <a href="https://github.com/goern/grasshopper/wiki#welcome-to-the-grasshopper-wiki">some experiments with grasshopper</a>
which need to be picked up and brought forward in a more structured way.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To conclude the first year of Nulecule and Atomic App work: it&#8217;s hard to kick off
a new thing, and it needs a lot of work, on the marketing aspects, on community and
collaboration and on technical aspects.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If I want to help with the 'definition of Application Entity' the tight integration
of Nulecule and Kubernetes/OpenShift configurations needs to get some more focus.</p>
